I can't see the specific details of the tactics page you're referring to. However, I can provide a general overview of how to analyze soccer tactics, formations, and player arrangements.

### Analyzing Soccer Tactics

1. **Formations**:
   - Common formations include 4-4-2, 4-3-3, 3-5-2, etc. Each formation has a specific shape and strategy.
   - For example, a 4-4-2 typically has four defenders, four midfielders, and two forwards, creating a balanced approach.

2. **Player Positions**:
   - Identify key positions such as goalkeeper, defenders, midfielders, and forwards.
   - Look for specific roles like center-backs, wing-backs, attacking midfielders, and target strikers.

3. **Team Shapes**:
   - Observe how teams shift between attacking and defensive shapes. 
   - For example, when defending, a team might drop into a compact shape, while in attack, they may spread out to create width.

4. **Key Observations**:
   - Analyze how Pakistan and their opponent (Afghanistan) are positioned. Look for:
     - Defensive organization: How many players are behind the ball?
     - Offensive strategies: How do they create space and opportunities?
     - Pressing: Are they applying pressure high up the pitch or sitting back?

5. **Shape Changes**:
   - Note how teams adjust their formations during the game. For instance:
     - Transitioning from a defensive to an attacking shape when regaining possession.
     - How substitutions impact the formation and strategy.

6. **Match Context**:
   - Consider the significance of the match (e.g., qualifiers) and how that might influence tactics (e.g., more cautious play to secure a draw).
