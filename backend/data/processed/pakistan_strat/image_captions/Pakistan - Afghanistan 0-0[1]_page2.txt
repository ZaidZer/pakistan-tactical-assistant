### Key Observations
- **Pakistan's Shape**: 
  - The team appears compact in defense, with a strong central presence in midfield. The two forwards can stretch the opponent's defense, but they may struggle for service if the midfield does not maintain possession.

- **Afghanistan's Shape**: 
  - Afghanistan has a more dynamic midfield with three attacking midfielders supporting a lone striker. This allows for quick transitions and more attacking options, which could create overloads against Pakistan's defense.

- **Changing Shapes**: 
  - As the match progresses, substitutions will likely impact both teams' shapes. For example, Pakistan's introduction of fresh legs in the midfield and attack (substitutes like Otis Khan and M. Abdullah) may shift their shape to a more aggressive 4-2-4 when chasing a goal.
  - Afghanistan may also adapt by bringing in more defensive players to maintain their lead or to solidify their midfield.

### Conclusion
The tactical setup indicates a clash between a more structured and defensive Pakistan and a fluid, attacking Afghanistan. The effectiveness of each team's strategy will depend on their ability to adapt to the opponent's movements and capitalize on opportunities in transition.
